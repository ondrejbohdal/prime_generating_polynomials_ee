# Prime Generating Polynomials - Mathematics Extended Essay
A research project into prime generating polynomials, in which I focused especially on developing my own methods and theorems on how to find linear and quadratic prime generating polynomials. I used C++ to support my research and find the individual polynomials. The essay was awarded with a top A grade.

This repository contains code used for generating linear and quadratic prime generating polynomials based on my own mathematics research.
